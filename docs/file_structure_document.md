# File Structure Document

## Introduction

A well-organized file structure is crucial in any software project, as it ensures seamless development and collaboration across teams. For the "OTT Device Matrix" project, this is especially important as the project aims to provide a comprehensive resource detailing the compatibility of various OTT streaming devices. An organized file structure helps maintain clarity and efficiency, which supports both development and maintenance efforts. This document outlines the organizational structure of the project files, ensuring that contributors can easily navigate and manage the project.

## Overview of the Tech Stack

The "OTT Device Matrix" project utilizes a robust tech stack tailored to both frontend and backend needs, which includes Next.js 14 with TypeScript for the frontend, MakeDocs for static site generation, and GitHub Pages for version control and hosting. Additionally, AI tools like ChatGPT and Bolt are integrated to assist with code and documentation processes. The choice of these technologies directly influences how the files are organized, emphasizing modularity, scalability, and ease of updates across the project.

## Root Directory Structure

At the root level, the project houses several key directories, each serving a specific purpose:

*   **src**: This directory contains the source code for the project, subdivided into frontend and backend components.
*   **docs**: Uses MakeDocs for generating static site documentation, providing users with a searchable interface.
*   **config**: Houses configuration files necessary for project setup and deployment, such as `next.config.js` for Next.js settings.
*   **public**: Contains static resources like images and icons used by the front-end.
*   **scripts**: Includes automation scripts to streamline development tasks such as data updates and deployment.
*   **tests**: Dedicated to unit and integration tests, ensuring code quality and functionality. Additionally, important files like `README.md` for project overview and `package.json` for dependency management reside here.

## Frontend File Structure

The frontend structure within the `src` directory is organized to enhance modularity and reusability:

*   **components**: This subdirectory contains reusable UI components used throughout the app.
*   **pages**: Includes main entry points for different project screens, leveraging Next.js’ built-in routing.
*   **styles**: Houses SCSS or CSS files that provide styling for the application’s look and feel.
*   **utils**: Utility functions that can be used across different parts of the frontend. This organization supports a scalable, maintainable codebase by ensuring each module serves a distinct and reusable purpose.

## Backend File Structure

In the same `src` directory, the backend is structured to support API development and data management:

*   **api**: Contains logic for the API endpoint that provides access to the device compatibility data from the JSON schema.
*   **models**: Holds the schemas and data models used within the node.js environment.
*   **services**: Manages business logic and rules, such as fetching and processing data from the JSON database.
*   **controllers**: Coordinates between models and views, handling incoming requests and returning responses. This modular setup allows for high maintainability and scalability as the project grows.

## Configuration and Environment Files

Configuration and environment files are strategically placed to manage build processes, dependencies, and environment variables:

*   **.env**: Contains environment variables that define configuration settings specific to each environment (e.g., development, production).
*   **.gitignore**: Specifies intentionally untracked files to ignore in the GitHub repository.
*   **tsconfig.json**: Configures TypeScript settings. Other essential files such as `next.config.js` are included to manage Next.js-specific configurations.

## Testing and Documentation Structure

Ensuring quality and knowledge sharing are facilitated by:

*   **tests**: Organized in the root-level `tests` directory, encompassing unit tests for both frontend and backend elements, supporting a TDD approach.
*   **docs**: Maintained in the `docs` directory, provides structured, AI-assisted documentation generated via MakeDocs, which supports collaborative updates and guidelines. These components ensure that code remains reliable and that documentation is continually updated and accurate.

## Conclusion and Overall Summary

The "OTT Device Matrix" project's file structure plays an essential role in supporting development efforts, from coding practices to documentation. Its clear segregation between frontend and backend, along with structured configuration and testing directories, assures maintainability and adaptability. The innovative use of AI tools in managing updates and documentation provides an edge, fostering continuous improvement and ease of collaboration. This well-organized file architecture sets a robust foundation for the effective ongoing development of the project.
