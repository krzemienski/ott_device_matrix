# System Prompts for Claude AI Integration

## Overview
Integrating Claude AI into the "OTT Device Compatibility Matrix" project will enhance the automation of documentation processes. Drawing on Claude's capabilities for intelligent code assistance, this document outlines system prompt strategies to optimize documentation based on JSON data updates.

## Prompts for Automatic Documentation Generation
Claude AI can be used to generate insights, summaries, and complete sections of device compatibility data when the JSON is updated.

### Prompt 1: JSON Schema Explanation
`"Summarize the details and significance of the current JSON schema for a technical audience, emphasizing changes from the previous version."`

This prompt helps developers and contributors understand the evolution of the JSON schema and its implications in a digestible format.

### Prompt 2: Device Data Overview
`"Provide a concise overview of device compatibility for [Device Model], highlighting key compatibility features and noting any new support added since the last update."`

This ensures that technical documentation remains accurate and up-to-date with device specifications.

### Prompt 3: Change Log Creation
`"Draft a changelog entry for the updated JSON file, noting major enhancements and compatibility shifts for easy reference by developers."`

This aids in maintaining a clear and communicable log of changes for contributors.

### Prompt 4: User Guide Section Autogeneration
`"Generate a user guide section based on the JSON data, focusing on how to interpret the device compatibility details presented, including common scenarios."`

Designed to help users make the best use of the data provided in the site, this prompt ensures comprehensive guidance is readily available.

### Prompt 5: Notification Script
`"Craft a notification script for stakeholders to alert them to new JSON updates, summarizing key changes and areas of interest."`

This prompt helps in quick communication about updates to all relevant parties, ensuring alignment and awareness.

### Prompt 6: API Endpoint Q&A
`"Devise a Q&A script for users on how to access and utilize the API endpoint, detailing common issues and troubleshooting steps."`

This supports user engagement by preemptively addressing potential questions and problems.
