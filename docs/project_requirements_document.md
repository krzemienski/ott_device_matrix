## Project Requirements Document (PRD)

### Project Overview

The "OTT Device Matrix" project aims to deliver a detailed and structured resource that outlines the compatibility of various Over-The-Top (OTT) streaming devices such as the Roku Ultra with different streaming technologies. This is achieved through a well-defined JSON schema, which catalogs each device's capabilities. These include the supported streaming protocols, such as various versions of HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) or MPEG-DASH. The project plans to offer an API endpoint that can access these compatibility details, alongside a statically generated, searchable table hosted as a Markdown file using MakeDocs. This table will be accessible on GitHub Pages, ensuring that users can easily find updated device compatibility information, maintained collectively by contributors.

This project is being developed to address the need for a centralized and organized source of streaming device compatibility data. The primary objectives include providing industry professionals and developers involved in the OTT streaming industry with an exhaustive resource that they can use to verify their own streaming applications' compatibility with various devices. By ensuring that this data is dynamic and up-to-date, the project aims to assist users in making informed decisions about which devices align with their streaming protocol requirements, thus eliminating the need for scattered and unreliable sources of information.

### In-Scope vs. Out-of-Scope

**In-Scope**

*   Designing a JSON schema that encapsulates detailed compatibility data of OTT devices.
*   Development of an API endpoint to access device compatibility data.
*   Creating a static, searchable site using MakeDocs, hosted on GitHub Pages.
*   Automation of site updates and documentation rebuilding upon modification of the JSON file.
*   Providing basic and advanced search and filter functionalities within the interface.
*   An admin panel for editing the `device_compatibility_matrix.json` file, with version control via GitHub.
*   Incorporation of AI tools like GPT-4o for automatic documentation update suggestions based on JSON data changes.

**Out-of-Scope**

*   Developing mobile applications for the interface.
*   Advanced analytics or telemetry features for user interaction or data usage metrics.
*   Support for non-web-based platforms for accessing the compatibility matrix.
*   Custom branding or highly tailored UI design elements.
*   Features related to direct OTT streaming, including media playback capabilities.

### User Flow

A new user typically arrives at the platform and is greeted by the main dashboard that allows them to perform searches on supported OTT devices. The interface is thoughtfully designed to accommodate both casual and professional users, with options for simple keyword searches as well as advanced filtering capabilities. Users are able to filter by device type, brand, operating system, streaming protocol versions, and other technical specifications as outlined in the JSON schema.

Upon selecting a device from search results, the user is directed to a dedicated Device Detail Page. Here, they find comprehensive information on the device's compatibility, including details such as supported codecs, streaming formats, and DRM (Digital Rights Management) support. For those interested in contributing to the database, an Admin Panel offers tools to modify the JSON input, with changes reflected via GitHubâ€™s version control system. Contributors can suggest updates through structured workflows, such as pull requests or flagging issues, ensuring continual refinement of the matrix.

### Core Features

*   **JSON Schema Definition:** Set-up and organization of a JSON scheme to standardize device compatibility data.
*   **API Endpoint Development:** Creation of an API for API-based access to compatibility data.
*   **Static, Searchable Site:** Utilize MakeDocs to build a site for users to search and view compatibility details.
*   **Automated Site Updates:** Integrating continuous deployment processes to update the site with each JSON file edit.
*   **Advanced Search and Filter:** Provide both simple and complex search functionalities.
*   **Admin Panel for Data Management:** Interface for editing JSON data with GitHub-based version tracking.
*   **AI-driven Documentation:** Use AI to offer automatic documentation updates and suggestions.

### Tech Stack & Tools

*   **Frontend Framework:** Next.js 14 using TypeScript for a robust build.
*   **Static Site Generation:** MakeDocs for efficient creation of documentation and static content.
*   **Version Control & Hosting:** Utilizes GitHub Pages for straightforward version control and hosting.
*   **AI Tools:** Bolt, Claude AI, V0 by Vercel, ChatGPT for code and content generation; Cursor AI for coding support.
*   **Development Environments:** IDEs such as Windsurf, VSCode, and Expo for thorough development support.

### Non-Functional Requirements

*   **Performance:** Fast load times expected, ideally under 2 seconds for page load.
*   **Security:** Ensure secure access to the API endpoint with proper authentication.
*   **Compliance:** Adhering to the latest web standards for accessibility.
*   **Usability:** Intuitive interface for broad user engagement without compromising on advanced features.

### Constraints & Assumptions

*   **Access to AI Models:** Continued availability and access to GPT-4o and related AI services.
*   **GitHub Dependence:** Relies heavily on GitHub Pages and collaborative tools for development and hosting.

### Known Issues & Potential Pitfalls

*   **API Rate Limits:** Possibility of hitting API rate limits on GitHub or other integrated services.
*   **Data Consistency:** Ensuring consistency and accuracy of data across multiple user-contributed updates.
*   **Platform Restrictions:** Limitations of GitHub Pages for hosting dynamic content, addressed by static site generation through MakeDocs.

To mitigate these issues, careful planning of automation workflows, robust version control practices, and community guidelines for contributions are crucial.
