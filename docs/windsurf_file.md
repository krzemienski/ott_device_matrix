Windsurf File for Project

## Project Overview

**Project Name:** OTT Device Compatibility Matrix

**Description:** The OTT Device Compatibility Matrix project is focused on creating a comprehensive resource for developers and industry professionals to determine the compatibility of various OTT streaming devices, such as Roku Ultra, with specific streaming technologies. This is facilitated through a JSON schema detailing each device's capabilities, which include supported streaming protocols and versions. The project will provide a searchable static site for easy access to this information, hosted on GitHub Pages.

**Tech Stack:**

*   **Frontend:** Next.js 14 with TypeScript
*   **Static Site Generation:** MakeDocs
*   **Version Control and Hosting:** GitHub Pages

**Key Features:**

*   JSON schema to standardize device compatibility data
*   API endpoint for accessing compatibility data
*   Static, searchable site generation using MakeDocs
*   Automated site updates with GitHub Pages integration
